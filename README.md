1.Dataset Gathering with OpenCV: OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. In this step, you're using it along with a webcam to capture custom frames. These frames likely contain images of hands in various positions or gestures. After capturing these frames, you're storing the data in a repository, which could be a folder on your computer or a database.
